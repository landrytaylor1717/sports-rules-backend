    "title": "Field Layout",
    "content": "A baseball field is arranged based on standardized measurements and guidelines. The infield is a square that’s 90 feet on each side, and the outfield extends beyond this, shaped by two foul lines. Ideally, the field should have at least 320 feet down the foul lines and 400 feet to center field, with a minimum of 250 feet to any obstacle in fair territory. The field must be level in key areas — especially along the baselines and home plate. The pitcher’s mound should be 10 inches higher than home plate, and the slope from the mound to the plate must be even, descending 1 inch for every foot over 6 feet. All ground within the baselines and outfield foul lines is considered fair territory; everything else is foul. Ideally, the line from home plate through the pitcher’s mound to second base should point East-Northeast to reduce sun glare. There should be at least 60 feet of clearance between home plate and the backstop, as well as between the baselines and any nearby fencing or seating. Precise base locations are determined by measuring 127 feet, 3 3/8 inches from home plate to second base, and then using 90-foot measurements between bases to locate first and third base. The distance between first and third base is also 127 feet, 3 3/8 inches. Features such as the batter’s box, catcher’s box, coach’s boxes, and other standard markings should be laid out according to official diagrams. Field markings — like foul lines — must be clearly defined using white, non-toxic materials such as chalk or paint. The grass layout can vary by team, but certain dimensions must be maintained: The edge of the infield dirt should form a radius of about 95 feet from the pitcher’s mound. A small range of 94–96 feet is acceptable. The dirt between home plate and first base must extend at least 18 inches and no more than 24 inches from the foul line. Note: Any professional baseball field built after June 1, 1958, must have foul lines at least 325 feet long and a center field fence no closer than 400 feet. Existing fields cannot be remodeled to reduce those distances.",

A second visit in the same inning requires removing the pitcher. No second visit is allowed during the same batter unless a pinch-hitter is subbed in—then the pitcher must be removed. Leaving the mound circle means the visit is over. Trying to sneak in extra visits (like sending an infielder instead) still counts as a visit. If warned and the manager still makes a second visit illegally, they are ejected. The pitcher must finish pitching to that batter and then be removed. 5.10(m) Limit on Mound Visits Each team is allowed 4 mound visits per 9 innings (without changing the pitcher). One extra visit is added for each extra inning. A visit includes: Manager/coach talking to the pitcher Player leaving position to talk to the pitcher A pitcher talking to a teammate Exceptions: injury, offensive substitution, between batters, spike cleaning, replay delay, inning breaks, etc. If signs get crossed (pitcher and catcher confused), umpires may allow a brief visit even if the limit has been reached. If a team goes over its limit: A coach must change pitchers. If no reliever is ready, the coach may be ejected. Position players making illegal visits may also be ejected. Baseball"

    "title": "Interference, Obstruction, and Catcher Collisions",
    "content": "a) Batter or Runner Interference A batter or runner is called for interference when they: Hinder the catcher after striking out on a dropped third strike. Ball is dead, the batter-runner is out, and other runners return. If the ball is deflected off the batter or umpire near home, it's a dead ball. Intentionally touch or deflect a foul ball. Interfere with a play at home plate before two outs while a runner is on third—runner is out. Crowd around a base to confuse fielders—runner is out. Interfere with a play after being put out or after scoring—runner is out. Deliberately break up a double play by interfering with a batted ball or fielder—both the runner and batter-runner are out. Batter-runner does the same as #6—the closest runner to home is also out. Base coach physically helps a runner—runner is out. Coach leaves the box to draw a throw—runner is out. Runner fails to avoid a fielder fielding a batted ball or intentionally interferes with a throw—runner is out. If multiple fielders are involved, the umpire decides which one has the right to the play. If contact is accidental and the batter didn’t hinder the fielder, the runner may be safe. A fair ball hits a runner in fair territory before touching a fielder—runner is out. Not out if the ball passes a fielder or is deflected first, unless the runner kicks it on purpose. PENALTY: Runner is out. Ball is dead. Other runners return to their bases unless stated otherwise. If interference occurs between third and home and the succeeding runner reaches third, that runner goes back to second. b) Fielder’s Right of Way All offensive players must get out of the way when a fielder is trying to field a batted or thrown ball. If someone other than a runner gets in the way: batter is out and runners return. If it’s a thrown ball: the runner being played on is out. c) Catcher’s Interference If the catcher or a fielder interferes with the batter’s swing: The batter is awarded first base. The offensive manager can decline the interference and take the play instead. d) Unintentional Interference If someone on the field not actively playing (like a ball boy) unintentionally interferes, the play continues. If it’s intentional, the umpire stops play and may apply penalties to fix it. e) Spectator Interference If a fan interferes: Ball is dead. Umpire decides what would’ve happened without the interference and places runners accordingly. If a fly ball could’ve been caught, the batter is out. f) Coach and Umpire Interference If a coach unintentionally gets hit by a thrown ball, the play continues. If a coach interferes, the runner is out. If an umpire interferes with a catcher or a fair ball, it can result in umpire interference and the play may be stopped. g) Interference on a Squeeze Play or Steal of Home If a catcher or fielder blocks the plate or touches the batter without the ball: It's a balk, batter goes to first, and the ball is dead. h) Obstruction If a fielder blocks a runner: During a play on the runner: ball is dead and runners advance to the base they would’ve reached. No play on runner: play continues, then umpire may award bases. A fielder can only block a runner if he's fielding the ball or has it in possession. i) Collisions at Home Plate Runner can't intentionally collide with catcher. If he does, he's out. Sliding legally into home is okay. Catcher can’t block the plate without the ball. If he does, the runner is safe. If the throw pulls the catcher into the runner's path or the runner could’ve slid, it may not be a violation. j) Sliding to Break Up Double Plays To avoid being called for interference: A runner must make a legal slide (i.e., starts slide before the base, stays within reach, doesn’t try to hit the fielder). Illegal slides (e.g., roll blocks, kicking legs up) result in both the runner and batter-runner being out. Rule 6.02 – Pitcher’s Illegal Actions A pitcher may not: Spit on the ball, his hand, or glove. Rub the ball on his glove, uniform, or body. Apply any foreign substance to the ball. Deface or damage the ball in any way. Throw an altered ball, including a spitball, shine ball, mud ball, or emery ball. Note: The pitcher may rub the ball between bare hands only. Carry or use any foreign substance on his person or in his glove. Example: Bandages, tape, glue, or bracelets are not allowed on the pitching hand, fingers, or wrist. Delay the game by throwing to fielders instead of the catcher while the batter is ready. Penalty: After one warning, continued delay means ejection. Intentionally pitch at a batter. Penalty: The umpire may eject the pitcher and/or manager immediately or issue a warning. A second offense results in automatic ejection. Note: Umpires can issue warnings before or during a game if needed. Teams or managers cannot argue these warnings or they will be ejected. Umpire Discretion: Umpires may issue a warning instead of an ejection if the pitcher’s illegal act appears unintentional. Pitchers are automatically ejected and suspended (10 games in the minors) for violations of items (2)–(7), unless the team at bat accepts the outcome of the play. Rule 6.03 – Batter’s Illegal Actions A batter is out if: He hits the ball with both feet outside the batter’s box. He switches boxes while the pitcher is ready to pitch. He interferes with the catcher by stepping out or making a movement that disrupts a play at the plate. He throws his bat and hits the catcher or glove during a third-strike play with runners on base. Exceptions: If the runner is put out despite the interference, the batter is not penalized. Note: If the bat unintentionally hits the catcher on the follow-through of a swing, it's just a strike; the ball is dead. He uses a tampered bat (e.g., filled, grooved, hollowed, or coated). Penalty: The batter is out, ejected, and may face further suspension. No bases are awarded for advancements caused by the illegal bat. Rule 6.03(b) – Batting Out of Turn If a batter bats out of turn and it’s appealed, the correct batter is out and the play is nullified. If the mistake isn’t caught before a pitch to the next batter, the out-of-turn batter becomes legal and the order continues from there. If the proper batter is on base, skip him in the order. The umpire won’t alert anyone to an out-of-order batter — it’s the team’s responsibility. Rule 6.04 – Unsportsmanlike Conduct No player, coach, or manager may: Incite fans with words or actions. Use abusive or insulting language toward opponents, umpires, or fans. Attempt to cause a balk by yelling or distracting the pitcher. Make physical contact with an umpire. Sit or mingle with fans while in uniform, or fraternize with opponents. Other restrictions: Fielders may not try to distract batters intentionally. Anyone ejected must leave the field and cannot return in uniform or access restricted areas (like dugouts or press boxes). Teams must stop showing strong disapproval after an umpire’s call. If they don’t, the umpire may eject the offenders or clear the entire bench.",

If a call is reversed, umpires can reposition runners or undo consequences from the original call to make things right. No one can argue how the umpires choose to resolve a reversed call. Managers can ask for an explanation, but not debate it. On a check swing (half swing), the manager or catcher can ask the plate umpire to check with the base umpire only if the pitch was called a ball. If the base umpire says it was a swing, the strike call stands. Appeals must be made immediately—before the next pitch or play. d) Umpires cannot be replaced during a game unless injured or ill. e) In one-umpire games, that umpire has full authority and can work from any position on the field. f) In multi-umpire crews, one is designated the crew chief (umpire-in-chief), usually the plate umpire.

The runner is tagged out or overslides. If a runner is caught due to a muffed throw or other mistake, it’s not scored as a steal. Rule 9.07(a) - Caught Stealing If a runner tries to advance on a wild pitch or passed ball and is thrown out, do not count it as a caught stealing. Do not record a caught stealing if the runner: Is awarded a base due to obstruction. Is out because of batter interference. Would not have been credited with a stolen base even if safe. Rule 9.08 - Sacrifices Sacrifice Bunt: Credit when: The batter bunts to advance a runner with less than two outs and is put out or would have been out except for an error. The batter’s intent was clearly to help the team, not to get a hit. No Sacrifice: If the batter: Was bunting for a base hit. Causes a runner to be thrown out or would have been out if not for an error. Sacrifice Fly: Credit when: With less than two outs, a fly ball leads to a runner scoring after the catch, or would have if it hadn’t been dropped. Rule 9.09 - Putouts A fielder gets a putout if they: Catch a fly ball. Tag a base or a runner for an out. Automatic Putouts: Credit to catcher on strikeouts and certain rules violations like interference or refusing to run. Rule 9.10 - Assists A fielder gets an assist for contributing to an out by throwing or deflecting the ball. No assist for: Strikeouts unless the pitcher makes a throw. Pickoffs or steals caught by the catcher alone. Plays following an error. Rule 9.11 - Double/Triple Plays Credit to any fielder involved in outs during a double or triple play, unless an error interrupts the sequence. Rule 9.12 - Errors An error is charged when a fielder misplays a ball and helps the offense, like: Dropping a catchable ball. Making a wild throw that lets runners advance. No Error: For mental mistakes, judgment calls, or slow handling (unless a clear misplay occurs). Only one error per wild throw, regardless of how many runners advance. Rule 9.13 Wild Pitches and Passed Balls Wild Pitch: Charged to the pitcher if the ball is too wild for the catcher to handle, allowing runners to advance. Passed Ball: Charged to the catcher if they fail to catch a good pitch, letting runners advance. No Charge: If the defense gets an out before any runner advances. Rule 9.14 - Base on Balls A walk is recorded when a batter gets four balls. If the pitcher clearly intends to walk the batter, it’s an intentional walk. If the batter refuses to go to first, no walk is recorded. Rule 9.15 - Strikeouts A strikeout is charged when: The third strike is caught or not caught (unless first base is occupied with less than two outs). A foul bunt is made with two strikes. If a new batter replaces one with two strikes and strikes out, it counts for the original batter. Rule 9.16 - Earned Runs An earned run is a run that scores without help from an error or passed ball. Runs are not earned if: The runner reached base due to an error or interference. The runner advanced or scored due to a misplay. Pitching Changes: Runs are charged to the pitcher who put the runner on base. If the count is heavily in favor of the batter when a pitcher is replaced, and the batter walks, the walk is charged to the first pitcher. Reconstructing the Inning: When calculating earned runs, assume no errors happened. Always give pitchers the benefit of the doubt. 9.17 Winning and Losing Pitcher a) The winning pitcher is the one on the mound when his team takes the lead for good. This can happen while he’s still pitching or during the inning he was just taken out. However, there are exceptions: If he’s a starting pitcher and the rule in b) applies. If c) applies due to ineffective relief pitching. Comment: When the game is tied, it resets who’s eligible to win. Once a team takes the lead, no previously replaced pitchers can earn the win. If the pitcher who allowed the go-ahead run stays in and his team reclaims the lead and keeps it, he gets the win. b) If the lead-changing pitcher is a starter and doesn’t pitch: At least 5 innings in a game of 6+ innings, or At least 4 innings in a game that lasts exactly 5 innings, then the win goes to a relief pitcher. If there’s only one reliever, he gets it. If there are multiple, the scorer decides who was most effective. Comment: To earn a win, a relief pitcher should pitch at least one full inning or get a key out in a crucial moment. Just being the first reliever doesn’t guarantee the win—effectiveness matters more. The scorer should weigh runs, earned runs, baserunners, and context. If two pitchers perform equally, give the edge to the earlier one. c) A relief pitcher won’t be credited with a win if he pitches poorly and another reliever performs better and helps keep the lead. In that case, the win goes to the most effective succeeding reliever. Comment: A brief, ineffective outing is typically less than one inning with two or more earned runs allowed. Use the same criteria as in b) when choosing among multiple effective relievers. d) The losing pitcher is the one who gave up the run that gave the opposing team a lead they never gave back. Comment: A tie resets the losing pitcher. Only the pitcher responsible for the decisive go-ahead run can take the loss. e) Leagues can waive some of these rules for special games (like the All-Star Game). In those, the win can still go to the pitcher in the game when the lead was taken, unless he was clearly ineffective and another pitcher deserves it more.",

No team may be reduced to less than five players. If a player in the game receives his sixth personal foul and all substitutes have already been dis-qualified, said player shall remain in the game and shall be charged with a personal and team foul. A technical foul also shall be assessed against his team. All subsequent personal fouls, including offensive fouls, shall be treated similarly. All players who have six or more personal fouls and remain in the game shall be treated similarly. In the event that there are only five eligible players remaining and one of these players is injured and must leave the game or is ejected, he must be replaced by the last player who was disqualified by reason of receiving six personal fouls. Each subsequent requirement to replace an injured or ejected player will be treated in this inverse order. Any such re- entry into a game by a disqualified player shall be penalized by a technical foul. In the event that a player leaves the playing court while the ball is in play, play will continue until the next stoppage of play and the player will be replaced if he is not ready to return. No technical foul will be assessed, but the incident will be reviewed by the league office for a possible fine and/or suspension. EXCEPTION: Rule 10—Section XV Section II—Starting Line-Ups At least 30 minutes before the game is scheduled to begin, the scorers shall be supplied with the name and number of each player who will start the game. Failure to comply with this provision shall be reported to the League Office. Section III—The Captain A team may have a captain and a co-captain numbering a maximum of two. The designated captain may be anyone on the active list who is in uniform, except a player-coach. The designated captain is the only player who may ask an official about a rule interpretation during a timeout charged to his team. He may not discuss a judgment decision. If the designated captain continues to sit on the bench, he remains the captain for the entire game. In the event that the captain is absent from the court and bench, his coach shall immediately designate a new captain. Section IV—The Coach and Others The coach’s position may be on or off the bench from the substitution box line (closest to the coach’s bench) to the baseline. A coach is not permitted to cross the midcourt line and violators will be assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul immediately. All assistants and trainers must remain on the bench. Coaches and trainers are not permitted to go to the scorer’s table, for any reason, except during a dead ball. A player-coach, if permitted under NBA regulations, will have no special privileges. He is to conduct himself in the same manner as any other player. Any club personnel not seated on the bench must conduct themselves in a manner that would reflect favorably on the dignity of the game and the officials. Violations by any of the personnel indicated shall require a written report to the League Office for subsequent action. The bench shall be occupied only by a league-approved head coach, a maximum of three assistant coaches, players and trainer. During an altercation, the head and assistant coaches are permitted on the court as ‘peacemakers. If a player, coach or assistant coach is suspended from a game or games, he shall not at any time before, during or after such game or games appear in any part of the arena or stands where his team is playing. A player, coach or assistant coach who is ejected may only remain in the dressing room of his team during the remainder of the game, or leave the building. A violation of this rule shall call for an automatic fine of $2000. Section V—Substitutes A substitute shall report to the scorer and position himself in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box located in front of the scorer’s table. For purposes of this rule, the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box means the area from between the 28’ hash mark closest to the bench of the player’s team and the midcourt line. He shall inform the scorer whom he is going to replace. The scorer shall sound the horn to indicate a substitution. The horn does not have to be sounded if the substitution occurs between periods or during timeouts. The substitute shall remain in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box until he is beckoned onto the court by an official. If the ball is about to become live, the beckoning signal shall be withheld. A substitute must be ready to enter the game when beckoned. No delays for removal of warm-up clothing will be permitted. The substitute shall not replace a free throw shooter or a player involved in a jump ball unless dictated to do so by an injury or ejection. (EXCEPTION: Rule 6 -Section VI – b and Rule 9 -Section II – a – (2)) . At no time may he be allowed to attempt a free throw awarded as a result of a technical foul. A substitute shall be considered as being in the game when he is beckoned onto the court or recognized as being in the game by an official. Once a player is in the game, he can- not be removed until the ball is legally touched by a player on the court unless: (1) a personal or technical foul is called, (2) there is a change of possession, (3) a timeout is granted or (4) administration of infection control rule. A substitute may be recalled from the scorer’s table prior to being beckoned onto the court by an official. A player may be replaced and allowed to re-enter the game as a substitute during the same dead ball. A player must be in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution box at the time a violation occurs if the throw-in is to be administered in the backcourt. If a substitute fails to meet this requirement, he may not enter the game until the next legal opportunity. EXCEPTION: In the last two minutes of each period or overtime, a reasonable amount of time will be allowed for a substitution. If a free throw(s) is awarded, substitutes are only permitted to enter the game prior to the final free throw attempt if the ball will remain in play or following the final free throw attempt if it will not remain in play unless necessitated by disqualification, injury, ejection or any other atypical situation. No substitutes may enter the game after a successful field goal by either team, unless the ball is dead due to a personal foul, technical foul, timeout, infection control or violation. No substitutes are allowed to enter the game during an official’s suspension-of-play for (1) a delay-of-game warning, (2) retrieving an errant ball, (3) an inadvertent whistle, (4) instant replay review or (5) any other unusual circumstance. EXCEPTIONS: Suspension of play for a player bleeding. See Comments on the Rules—N. Seriously-injured player. Player must be removed and opponent is permitted one substitution.

The designated captain is the only player who may ask an official about a rule interpretation during a timeout charged to his team. He may not discuss a judgment decision. If the designated captain continues to sit on the bench, he remains the captain for the entire game. In the event that the captain is absent from the court and bench, his coach shall immediately designate a new captain. Section IV—The Coach and Others The coach’s position may be on or off the bench from the substitution box line (closest to the coach’s bench) to the baseline. A coach is not permitted to cross the midcourt line and violators will be assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul immediately. All assistants and trainers must remain on the bench. Coaches and trainers are not permitted to go to the scorer’s table, for any reason, except during a dead ball. A player-coach, if permitted under NBA regulations, will have no special privileges. He is to conduct himself in the same manner as any other player. Any club personnel not seated on the bench must conduct themselves in a manner that would reflect favorably on the dignity of the game and the officials. Violations by any of the personnel indicated shall require a written report to the League Office for subsequent action. The bench shall be occupied only by a league-approved head coach, a maximum of three assistant coaches, players and trainer. During an altercation, the head and assistant coaches are permitted on the court as ‘peacemakers. If a player, coach or assistant coach is suspended from a game or games, he shall not at any time before, during or after such game or games appear in any part of the arena or stands where his team is playing. A player, coach or assistant coach who is ejected may only remain in the dressing room of his team during the remainder of the game, or leave the building. A violation of this rule shall call for an automatic fine of $2000. Section V—Substitutes A substitute shall report to the scorer and position himself in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box located in front of the scorer’s table. For purposes of this rule, the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box means the area from between the 28’ hash mark closest to the bench of the player’s team and the midcourt line. He shall inform the scorer whom he is going to replace. The scorer shall sound the horn to indicate a substitution. The horn does not have to be sounded if the substitution occurs between periods or during timeouts. The substitute shall remain in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution Box until he is beckoned onto the court by an official. If the ball is about to become live, the beckoning signal shall be withheld. A substitute must be ready to enter the game when beckoned. No delays for removal of warm-up clothing will be permitted. The substitute shall not replace a free throw shooter or a player involved in a jump ball unless dictated to do so by an injury or ejection. (EXCEPTION: Rule 6 -Section VI – b and Rule 9 -Section II – a – (2)) . At no time may he be allowed to attempt a free throw awarded as a result of a technical foul. A substitute shall be considered as being in the game when he is beckoned onto the court or recognized as being in the game by an official. Once a player is in the game, he can- not be removed until the ball is legally touched by a player on the court unless: (1) a personal or technical foul is called, (2) there is a change of possession, (3) a timeout is granted or (4) administration of infection control rule. A substitute may be recalled from the scorer’s table prior to being beckoned onto the court by an official. A player may be replaced and allowed to re-enter the game as a substitute during the same dead ball. A player must be in the vicinity of the 8’ Substitution box at the time a violation occurs if the throw-in is to be administered in the backcourt. If a substitute fails to meet this requirement, he may not enter the game until the next legal opportunity. EXCEPTION: In the last two minutes of each period or overtime, a reasonable amount of time will be allowed for a substitution. If a free throw(s) is awarded, substitutes are only permitted to enter the game prior to the final free throw attempt if the ball will remain in play or following the final free throw attempt if it will not remain in play unless necessitated by disqualification, injury, ejection or any other atypical situation. No substitutes may enter the game after a successful field goal by either team, unless the ball is dead due to a personal foul, technical foul, timeout, infection control or violation. No substitutes are allowed to enter the game during an official’s suspension-of-play for (1) a delay-of-game warning, (2) retrieving an errant ball, (3) an inadvertent whistle, (4) instant replay review or (5) any other unusual circumstance. EXCEPTIONS: Suspension of play for a player bleeding. See Comments on the Rules—N. Seriously-injured player. Player must be removed and opponent is permitted one substitution. A substitute shall not be allowed to re-enter the game after being disqualified. EXCEPTION: Rule 3—Section I—b. Notification of all above infractions and ensuing procedures shall be in accordance with Rule 2—Section VII. Section VI—Uniforms (Players Jerseys) Each player shall be numbered on the front and back of his jersey with a number contrasting with the color of the Each number must be no less than ¾” in height on the front and 6” on the Each player shall have his surname affixed to the back of his game jersey in letters at least 2½” in height.

Penalty for violation: If the free throw attempt remains live, the opposing team will inbound from either sideline at the free throw line extended.

A maximum of two unsportsmanlike technical fouls can be assessed to any individual; one unsportsmanlike technical foul can result in ejection, and two require ejection.

Unsportsmanlike technical fouls include disrespecting officials, physical contact with officials, excessive dissent, profanity, unauthorized court entry by coach, deliberate elbows or unnatural acts without contact, taunting, or prolonged criticism. Excessive misconduct can lead to ejection. Technical fouls should be avoided but must be enforced promptly when necessary. After ejection or game end, no further technical fouls are assessed.

Exceptions: A defender may use a forearm on an offensive player with their back to the basket below the free throw line extended, outside the Lower Defensive Box. A defender may use a forearm and/or one bent elbow hand on an offensive player in a post-up position within the Lower Defensive Box. A defender may use a forearm at any time within the Lower Defensive Box to maintain defensive position. A defender may place a leg between the legs of an offensive player in a post-up to maintain position, but if the foot leaves the floor to dislodge the opponent, it is a foul immediately. Incidental hand contact that does not affect an offensive player’s speed, balance, or rhythm should be ignored. If illegal contact is caused indirectly to a third player, the original player committing the contact is charged with a personal foul. A personal foul by the offense during a throw-in is always an offensive foul, regardless of ball release. Contact on the offensive player's hand while holding the ball is legal. Exception: Flagrant and punching fouls. Penalties: The player committing the foul is charged with a personal foul. The defending team is charged a team foul if they cause the illegal contact. No team foul is charged if the offense commits the foul or if both teams have equal personal fouls. The offended team is awarded: The ball out-of-bounds at the nearest sideline spot where play stopped, no closer to the baseline than the free throw line extended if the foul is offensive. The ball out-of-bounds at the nearest sideline spot if the foul is defensive and no penalty is in effect. One free throw attempt if the foul is defensive and a successful field goal or free throw occurred. Two or three free throws if the defensive foul occurred during an unsuccessful shooting attempt. One free throw plus a penalty free throw if the defensive foul occurs off the ball and penalty applies. Two free throws and sideline possession nearest the interruption if a clear-path-to-the-basket foul occurs during transition scoring opportunities under specified conditions. Two free throws if a personal foul occurs against an offensive player without the ball during a fast break with at least a one-player advantage, and the defender fouls to stop play. Basketball"

For example, Challenges cannot be used for fouls on the opposing team, continuation calls, Technical or Flagrant Fouls, or violations like traveling, carrying, double dribble, flopping, or three-second violations. While continuation may be reviewed when related to a challenged foul, it cannot be challenged on its own. Basketball"

If the passer starts moving his hand forward but loses the ball while bringing it back, it’s a fumble. If he loses the ball while re-cocking, that’s also a fumble. Legal Forward Pass Only one forward pass is allowed per play, and only if the ball hasn’t crossed the line of scrimmage. Once the ball crosses the line, no forward pass can be made—even if it returns behind the line. Illegal Passes (Fouls) Forward passes are illegal if: The passer and ball are completely beyond the line of scrimmage when the ball is released. It’s the second forward pass on the same play. The ball crossed the line and came back, then was passed forward. The pass is made after a change of possession. Penalties for Illegal Passes Beyond line: 5-yard penalty from throw spot + loss of down. Second forward pass or after crossing line: 5 yards from previous spot + loss of down. After change of possession: 5 yards from throw spot. Completion and Interception A forward pass is complete or intercepted if: The player catches the ball before it hits the ground. He lands inbounds with both feet or any part of the body (except hands). He performs a football move (e.g., tucking the ball, turning upfield). Key points: Losing the ball when hitting the ground after catching = incomplete. A player pushed out while catching and controlled the ball = complete. Simultaneous catch by offense and defense = ball goes to offense. If a player is carried out of bounds before landing, it’s a catch. If part of a foot lands out of bounds, the player is out. Incomplete Pass A pass is incomplete if: The catch process isn’t completed. The ball goes out of bounds. The first person to touch the ball had just been out of bounds.",

Article 2: Fair Catch Signal Valid signal: While the kick is in the air, the player fully extends one arm above his helmet and waves it side to side. Invalid signal: Any other way of raising hands above the shoulders or signaling behind the line of scrimmage is invalid. Penalties for Invalid Signal: 5-yard penalty from the spot of the invalid signal. If the invalid signal happens in the end zone during a free kick, penalty enforced from previous spot. Additional notes on fair catch: After a valid signal, if the ball is muffed (touched but not caught), the player still has a chance to catch it without interference. Intentional muffing forward before catching is illegal (illegal bat). A player who signals fair catch (valid or invalid) cannot block or initiate contact with the kicking team until the ball touches someone else. Penalty: 15 yards for illegal block. Article 3: Restrictions If a valid fair catch signal is given and the ball is not touched by the kicking team: Catching the ball ends the play immediately with a fair catch. Muffing but then catching the ball before it hits the ground also counts as a fair catch. Recovering the ball after it hits the ground is not a fair catch; the play is dead but not a fair catch. If a teammate catches or recovers without signaling, it’s dead but not a fair catch. If the ball touches the kicking team (before or after ground), any receiver can catch or recover and advance. After a valid fair catch, opponents cannot block, tackle, or cause contact with the receiver. Incidental contact is allowed. Penalty: 15 yards for illegal contact; disqualification if flagrant. Article 4: Putting the Ball in Play After a Fair Catch After a fair catch (or fair catch awarded due to interference), the receiving team can start the next play by: A snap from the spot of the catch (or after penalty enforcement), or A fair catch kick (a free kick without a tee) from the spot of the catch. Article 5: Period Extension If time expires during a play with a fair catch signal: If the fair catch is made, the receiving team may choose to extend the period by attempting a fair catch kick, but not a snap. If interference occurs against the receiver who signaled, the receiving team can extend the period by either a fair catch kick or a snap after penalties are applied.",

A player who signals fair catch (valid or invalid) cannot block or initiate contact with the kicking team until the ball touches someone else. Penalty: 15 yards for illegal block. Article 3: Restrictions If a valid fair catch signal is given and the ball is not touched by the kicking team: Catching the ball ends the play immediately with a fair catch. Muffing but then catching the ball before it hits the ground also counts as a fair catch. Recovering the ball after it hits the ground is not a fair catch; the play is dead but not a fair catch. If a teammate catches or recovers without signaling, it’s dead but not a fair catch. If the ball touches the kicking team (before or after ground), any receiver can catch or recover and advance. After a valid fair catch, opponents cannot block, tackle, or cause contact with the receiver. Incidental contact is allowed. Penalty: 15 yards for illegal contact; disqualification if flagrant. Article 4: Putting the Ball in Play After a Fair Catch After a fair catch (or fair catch awarded due to interference), the receiving team can start the next play by: A snap from the spot of the catch (or after penalty enforcement), or A fair catch kick (a free kick without a tee) from the spot of the catch. Article 5: Period Extension If time expires during a play with a fair catch signal: If the fair catch is made, the receiving team may choose to extend the period by attempting a fair catch kick, but not a snap. If interference occurs against the receiver who signaled, the receiving team can extend the period by either a fair catch kick or a snap after penalties are applied. Football"

Flagrant fouls may lead to disqualification. Defensive fouls also result in an automatic first down. Article 2. Fouls to Prevent a Score The defense may not commit repeated fouls to stop a score. After a warning, repeated fouls result in awarding the score to the offense. Article 3. Intentional Fouls to Manipulate Game Clock Teams cannot commit multiple fouls in the same down to manipulate the clock. Penalty: 15-yard penalty and game clock reset to the snap time; clock starts on the next snap. Article 4.

Non-Player Fouls Substitutes, coaches, attendants, or any other non-players allowed on the team bench must not engage in unsportsmanlike conduct at any time during the game, timeouts, or between halves. Sideline “loudspeaker” coaching is prohibited. Players may talk to coaches only when the coach is in their designated area during dead ball periods. Grounds crew or team personnel cannot clear snow from the field for Try kicks, field goals, punts, or kickoffs. Article 2. Team Attendants on the Field During Timeouts Team attendants and their assistants may enter the field during a team timeout to assist players. No other non-players may enter the field without the referee’s permission, except incoming substitutes. During timeouts, all game rules remain in effect. Only incoming substitutes, team attendants, or trainers attending to player welfare may be on the field. The head coach may enter to check on an injured player, but assistant coaches may not. Article 3. Bench Credentials Everyone in the team bench area, except eligible uniformed players, must wear visible credentials labeled “BENCH.” For NFL games, home teams get up to 27 credentials, visitors up to 25. These are for coaches, ineligible players, and support staff (trainers, doctors, equipment managers). Occasionally, people with game service credentials (e.g., ball crew, oxygen techs) may be temporarily allowed without bench credentials. Unauthorized persons are not permitted in bench areas. Article 4. Restricted Areas All team personnel must respect the bench zone and the six-foot white border surrounding the field. Only game officials are allowed inside this border during play. This rule protects players’ safety, officials’ visibility, and spectators’ sightlines. Violators may be penalized. Article 5. Movement on Sidelines Coaches and non-participating personnel (including uniformed but inactive players) may not move laterally along the sidelines beyond 18 yards from the middle of the bench (typically near the 25-yard lines). The head coach may move outside the bench area to call a timeout or challenge a ruling when the ball is outside the bench area. Movement inside the bench area must stay behind the six-foot white border. Article 6. Non-Bench Areas Only authorized and accredited personnel may be on field-level non-bench areas, including media, stadium staff, or entertainment crew. The home team is responsible for keeping unauthorized people off the field. Accredited photographers or personnel must stay out of end zones and official playing areas while the game is in progress.

Article 2: End of Regulation Coin Toss At the end of regulation, the Referee will immediately toss a coin at midfield. The visiting team captain will call the toss, just like the pregame coin toss. Article 3: Regular Season Overtime After a break of no more than three minutes, a 10-minute overtime period begins. Both teams must have a chance to possess the ball unless: The team receiving the kickoff scores a touchdown on their first possession, winning the game immediately. The kicking team scores a safety on the receiving team’s first possession, winning the game immediately. If the first possession does not score, the next score by either team wins. If the first possession results in a field goal: The other team gets a possession. If the second team scores a touchdown, they win. If the second team also kicks a field goal, the next score wins. If the second team doesn’t score, the first team wins. Only one 10-minute overtime period is played. If still tied, the game ends as a tie. Each team has two timeouts. Standard fourth-quarter timing rules apply. Article 4: Postseason Overtime After a break of no more than three minutes, a 15-minute overtime period starts. Both teams must have at least one possession unless the kicking team scores a safety on the receiving team’s first possession, immediately winning. After both teams have had a possession, the team with more points wins. If tied after both possessions or if the first possession scores nothing, the next score wins. If still tied after a 15-minute period, additional 15-minute overtime periods are played until a winner is decided. There is a two-minute break between overtime periods, but no halftime break after the second overtime. In the third overtime and beyond, the captain who lost the original coin toss gets the first choice of options unless the original winner deferred. Teams switch goals after the first, third, and subsequent odd-numbered overtime periods. Each team gets three timeouts per half. Standard timeout rules apply. Timing rules follow normal half and quarter timing at the end of second and fourth overtime periods. After the fourth overtime, another coin toss is held, and play continues until a winner is declared.

Points scored during the play count unless a replay review overturns the score or there is a foul that negates the play. If the player intercepting or recovering the ball does not attempt to advance, the official will blow the whistle to end the game. If the second team loses possession but the opponent committed a foul before the change, the second team’s possession isn’t over, and the game can’t end on that play unless the penalty extends their possession. Similar rules apply if fouls affect possession during the opening kickoff possession. A player is in possession when securely holding the ball inbounds. Defense gains possession by catching, intercepting, or recovering a loose ball. Only kicking plays count as an opportunity for possession for the receiving team. If the kicking team recovers the kick legally, the receiving team’s possession opportunity is considered complete. Punts or field goal attempts crossing the line of scrimmage and muffed by the receiving team count as an opportunity to possess for the receiving team.

Article 2: Field Control If spectators enter the field or disrupt the game to the point the Referee believes the game cannot continue, the Referee will call a timeout. The Referee will record the down, distance, ball position, and remaining time. The home team management will be instructed to clear the field. Once the field is clear, order is restored, and safety is assured, the game will resume—even if it requires using stadium lights. Article 3: Game Called If a game must be stopped due to law, darkness without lights, or other reasons, the home team, visiting team, and officials must immediately report to the Commissioner. The Commissioner will make a final decision after reviewing all reports. Article 4: Emergency Situations The NFL aims to complete all games whenever possible. However, if the Commissioner or appointed representatives determine that an emergency (such as severe weather, lightning, flooding, or power failure) prevents starting or continuing a game, the following rules will guide their decisions. The Commissioner has full authority to adjust procedures and may end a game early if it’s unlikely that resuming would affect the outcome. Article 5: League Authority The Commissioner, designated League staff, and the Referee have authority to declare emergencies. If the Commissioner or representatives aren’t present, the Referee has sole authority but must try to consult the Commissioner if delaying or interrupting the game. League officials will coordinate with team management and may seek outside advice (weather service, police) during delays. Article 6: Rescheduling if Game Not Started If a game can’t start as scheduled and cannot be played later that day due to an emergency, it must be rescheduled to a later date set by the Commissioner. Article 7: Threat Before Game If an emergency threat exists before a game (e.g., approaching storm), the game start time won’t be moved earlier unless there is enough time to do so safely and orderly. Article 8: Interrupted Game If a game is stopped during play due to an emergency and cannot finish that day, it will be resumed later from the point of interruption. Article 9: Alternate Dates and Locations When rescheduling a regular-season game, the Commissioner will try to hold it within two days and at the original site. If that isn’t possible, the game will be moved to the nearest available venue. If a game cannot be scheduled within two days, other emergency and unfair acts policies will apply. Article 10: Postseason Interruptions If a postseason game is interrupted and cannot resume the same day, the Commissioner will schedule completion as soon as possible, at the same or a suitable alternate site. The Commissioner will only end the game early if continuing would likely not change the outcome. Article 11: Resuming Interrupted Games When a game resumes after interruption, whether on the same or later date, play will continue from the exact point it stopped.

If one team is penalized, the face-off is in their defensive zone unless: The penalty follows a goal – face-off at center ice. The penalty is at the start or end of a period – center ice. The attacking team enters the zone too early – neutral zone. On a power play, the attacking team chooses the face-off dot in the offensive zone. Additional rules for face-off locations: If both teams commit a violation, face-off is in the same zone as the stoppage. If play stops near the end boards, the face-off is at the closest end-zone dot. No face-offs within 15 feet of the goal/sideboards or outside designated spots. If a goal is disallowed due to deflecting off an official, face-off happens in that zone. If a goal is scored illegally by the attacking team (e.g., kicked in), face-off is at the nearest neutral zone spot. If play stops for reasons not outlined in the rules, the puck is faced off near the last point of play. If players enter the attacking zone during a scrum, the face-off moves to the neutral zone near the defending blue line—even for icing, offside, or penalties. For Rule 71 (Premature Substitution), the face-off is: Beyond the center red line – at center ice. Before the red line – at the nearest spot in the zone where play stopped. If an injured player causes a stoppage: Face-off is where the puck was last played. If their team had control in the attacking zone, face-off moves outside the blue line.

Additional rules for face-off locations: If both teams commit a violation, face-off is in the same zone as the stoppage. If play stops near the end boards, the face-off is at the closest end-zone dot. No face-offs within 15 feet of the goal/sideboards or outside designated spots. If a goal is disallowed due to deflecting off an official, face-off happens in that zone. If a goal is scored illegally by the attacking team (e.g., kicked in), face-off is at the nearest neutral zone spot. If play stops for reasons not outlined in the rules, the puck is faced off near the last point of play. If players enter the attacking zone during a scrum, the face-off moves to the neutral zone near the defending blue line—even for icing, offside, or penalties. For Rule 71 (Premature Substitution), the face-off is: Beyond the center red line – at center ice. Before the red line – at the nearest spot in the zone where play stopped. If an injured player causes a stoppage: Face-off is where the puck was last played. If their team had control in the attacking zone, face-off moves outside the blue line. If the injury is in the defending zone, the attacking team keeps the zone. Hockey"

If a major penalty is ending and the team hasn’t placed a player in the box to return, they cannot ice the puck and will be penalized if they do. Rule 82 – Line Changes After a stoppage, the visiting team must change players first. Once their change is done, the home team has a chance to make substitutions. No changes are allowed after this process unless: A player is injured A penalty affects team strength A goalie is being replaced Teams that ice the puck or delay the game cannot make a line change. Line Change Timing: Visiting team: 5 seconds Referee raises hand to freeze changes Home team: 8 seconds Referee lowers hand to end all changes Late substitutions = players sent back + warning Future violations = bench minor penalty Face-off Delay: Once line changes are done, teams have 5 seconds to get into face-off position. One warning per team per game for being late. After that, a bench minor is given. Rule 83 – Off-side Players can't enter the attacking zone before the puck. A player is on-side if at least one skate is touching or behind the blue line. A delayed off-side occurs when players are off-side, but the puck is recoverable by the defending team or the off-side players are clearing the zone. Key Points: If an attacking player clears the zone (or goes to the bench), play can resume if no one touches the puck. If the puck is deflected back into the zone off an opponent or official, it may still be off-side depending on who caused the deflection. Goals scored on a delayed off-side are disallowed unless the defending team puts the puck into their own net. Face-off Location (for off-side): Skated in off-side: Face-off outside blue line Shot in: Face-off where it was shot Pressured defender: Face-off where puck originated Intentional off-side: Face-off in the offending team's zone Rule 84 – Overtime (Regular Season) If the game is tied after regulation, each team gets 1 point. A 5-minute overtime is played 3-on-3. First goal wins (team gets 2nd point). No intermission, just a quick ice cleaning. Overtime Notes: Teams switch ends (like the 2nd period). Goalies may be pulled for an extra skater, but if that team loses, they lose the 1 point. No changing goalies \"on the fly\" – only after a whistle. Overtime Penalties: Penalties adjust team strength but no team has fewer than 3 skaters. For example: 5-on-3 → start OT 5-on-3 4-on-4 → becomes 3-on-3 2 penalties → opposing team may have 5 skaters, other team stays at 3 Rule 84.4 – Shootout (Regular Season) If still tied after OT, a shootout decides the winner. 3 rounds per team; if still tied, sudden death rounds follow. No player can shoot twice until all eligible players have gone. No warm-up or goalie changes unless injured. The shootout adds one goal to the winning team’s score, but does not count as individual stats. Rule 85 – Puck Out of Play If the puck goes out of bounds, face-off is at the nearest spot where the puck was shot or deflected. If it goes off the glass or netting but play continues unnoticed, the play stands. If the puck: Gets stuck on net: whistle after 3 seconds Is covered or sat on: whistle Hits an official and goes out: face-off where contact occurred Penalties: Goalies who drop the puck on the net to stop play get a minor penalty. Rule 86 – Start of Game and Periods Games begin with a center ice face-off. Teams change ends after each period. Home team chooses which end to start on. Penalties for Delay: Teams not on the ice when a period starts = bench minor. Only starters may skate before the period starts; others go straight to the bench. Pre-Game: 16-minute warm-up per team, in their half of the rink. Teams must leave the ice 20 minutes before the game starts for resurfacing. Rule 87 – Time-Outs Each team gets one 30-second timeout per game, taken during a regular stoppage.

A 5-minute overtime is played 3-on-3. First goal wins (team gets 2nd point). No intermission, just a quick ice cleaning. Overtime Notes: Teams switch ends (like the 2nd period). Goalies may be pulled for an extra skater, but if that team loses, they lose the 1 point. No changing goalies \"on the fly\" – only after a whistle. Overtime Penalties: Penalties adjust team strength but no team has fewer than 3 skaters. For example: 5-on-3 → start OT 5-on-3 4-on-4 → becomes 3-on-3 2 penalties → opposing team may have 5 skaters, other team stays at 3 Rule 84.4 – Shootout (Regular Season) If still tied after OT, a shootout decides the winner. 3 rounds per team; if still tied, sudden death rounds follow. No player can shoot twice until all eligible players have gone. No warm-up or goalie changes unless injured. The shootout adds one goal to the winning team’s score, but does not count as individual stats. Rule 85 – Puck Out of Play If the puck goes out of bounds, face-off is at the nearest spot where the puck was shot or deflected. If it goes off the glass or netting but play continues unnoticed, the play stands. If the puck: Gets stuck on net: whistle after 3 seconds Is covered or sat on: whistle Hits an official and goes out: face-off where contact occurred Penalties: Goalies who drop the puck on the net to stop play get a minor penalty. Rule 86 – Start of Game and Periods Games begin with a center ice face-off. Teams change ends after each period. Home team chooses which end to start on. Penalties for Delay: Teams not on the ice when a period starts = bench minor. Only starters may skate before the period starts; others go straight to the bench. Pre-Game: 16-minute warm-up per team, in their half of the rink. Teams must leave the ice 20 minutes before the game starts for resurfacing. Rule 87 – Time-Outs Each team gets one 30-second timeout per game, taken during a regular stoppage. No timeouts: After icing After goalie stoppages from long shots During a shootout After certain stoppages caused by delaying actions Hockey"
